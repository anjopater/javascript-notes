## Arrow functions
- Are always anonymous functions
- You can use in function and arrow defaults arguments like (a = 0, r = 0,1)
- DonÂ´t use arraw function "when you really need `this`" and "when you need a method to bind to an object"
- In arrow functions the this is not bound for example in an on event..
- When you need to add prototype method
- When you need the keyword 'arguments' objects


## Promises

`const p = new Promises((resolve, reject)=>{
 setTimeOut(()=>{
    reject('err');
 })
})` 

## Prototype
object.prototype.name = function () { }

## Generators
Generators are functions which can be exited and later re-entered. Their context (variable bindings) will be saved across re-entrances

## Proxies
Ovewrite default behavior in objects
